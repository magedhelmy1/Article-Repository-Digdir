# Running the Code

## Overview

This section provides instructions on how to run the Streamlit application included in this repository, which is designed for visualizing vector embeddings. The application is located in `src/digdir/vectorEmbeddings/visualize_embeddings.py`.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.11 or higher installed on your machine.
- Streamlit installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:
-r requirements.txt


## Running the Application

To launch the Streamlit application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of this repository.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run src/digdir/vectorEmbeddings/visualize_embeddings.py
   ```

4. Streamlit will start the server, and your default web browser should open automatically with the application. If not, you can manually open the URL provided by Streamlit in your terminal.

## Usage

Once the application is running:

- Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the vector embeddings visualization.
- You can add datasets, select different embedding models, and adjust parameters to see how they affect the embeddings landscape.
