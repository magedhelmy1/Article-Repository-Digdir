# Demo Repository for Bias Detection in Embeddings

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and detection of biases within various embedding models. Our goal is to assess and mitigate potential biases in machine learning embeddings, ensuring fairer and more equitable outcomes in AI applications. This is a test repository where we experiment with different methodologies and techniques to identify and address bias within data representations.

## Objectives

- **Identify Bias**: Utilize analytical tools and techniques to uncover inherent biases within embeddings.
- **Assessment**: Evaluate the impact and extent of detected biases on model performance and decision-making.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop and test strategies to mitigate identified biases, aiming to improve fairness and accuracy.
- **Community Engagement**: Foster a community of researchers and practitioners focused on bias detection and mitigation in AI.
